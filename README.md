# Image-Classification
This project focuses on image classification of traffic signs using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The goal is to accurately recognize and classify road signs from images into one of the predefined classes, helping to lay the foundation for applications in autonomous driving and intelligent transportation systems.

üß† Problem Statement
Traffic signs play a critical role in road safety. Automatic recognition of traffic signs from images allows for enhanced decision-making in autonomous vehicles. This project aims to classify road sign images into their correct categories using a deep learning model based purely on image data.


üß± Model Architecture (CNN)
The CNN model is structured as follows:

Input Shape: (64, 64, 3) resized RGB images

Convolutional Layers: Multiple Conv2D layers with ReLU activation

Pooling Layers: MaxPooling to reduce dimensionality

Dropout: Applied after Conv layers to prevent overfitting

Flatten Layer: Converts 2D feature maps into 1D vector

Dense Layers: Fully connected layers for final classification

Output Layer: 43 units with softmax activation for multi-class output
